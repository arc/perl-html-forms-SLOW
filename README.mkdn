## ZOMG SO SLOW

This program is very close to the one I use to prune old versions of my
libraries from CPAN.  It is **incredibly slow** after it gets going.

Seriously.  Try it.

NYTProf suggests that it's HTML::Forms' `selected` getting called about nine
billion times or something.  Surely this is slowing down other people doing
other stuff, right?

Wanna make it faster?  Sure you do.

I included the latest HTML-Form so you can edit it right there and try over and
over â€” and run the tests as you change it to make sure it still works as it
should.
